# PDP-Analysis
A collaborative Python framework for qualitative movement analysis using the Point-Descriptor-Precedence (PDP) representation. Includes tools for dataset comparison, visualization, and variant-based experimentation.

PDP-Analysis provides a modular environment for exploring and comparing movement data through the Point-Descriptor-Precedence (PDP) representation — a qualitative approach for identifying spatiotemporal patterns such as lane changes, overtakes, or other interaction dynamics.

This repository is developed collaboratively by four contributors, each applying and extending PDP on their own datasets and experimental setups. The framework supports multiple PDP variants — fundamental, buffer, rough, and buffer-rough — and integrates automated visualization, clustering, and dimensionality-reduction modules.
